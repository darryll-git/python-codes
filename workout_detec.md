Import necessary libraries:
We import the required libraries, including OpenCV (cv2), NumPy (numpy), and the OpenPose class from a custom module openpose that contains the pose estimation functionality.

Define the SkillDetector class:
The SkillDetector class is responsible for initializing the necessary components, such as the specified skill, YOLOv3 object detection model (net), layer names, output layers, and the OpenPose instance for pose estimation.

Implement the detect_skill method:
The detect_skill method takes an input image as a parameter.
It performs object detection using the YOLOv3 model on the input image.
The method processes the object detection results to extract relevant information, such as class IDs, confidences, and bounding box coordinates, for each detected person.

Implement the pose estimation and skill check:
The method performs pose estimation using the OpenPose instance on the regions of interest (ROIs) extracted from the bounding boxes of detected people.
It collects the keypoints obtained from the pose estimation into the keypoints list.
The method then calls the check_skill function to determine if the specified skill (push-up or pull-up) is being performed based on the keypoints.

Implement the check_skill method:
The check_skill method contains the custom logic to determine if the specified skill is being performed based on the keypoints obtained from the pose estimation.
It includes example logic for push-ups and pull-ups, where specific keypoints (wrists for push-ups and elbows for pull-ups) are checked against predefined threshold values.
The method returns True if the skill is detected and False otherwise.

Create an instance of SkillDetector and perform skill detection:
An instance of the SkillDetector class is created with the specified skill (e.g., 'pushup').
An input image is loaded using OpenCV's imread function.
The detect_skill method is called on the pushup_detector instance to detect if the specified skill (push-up) is being performed in the image.

Display the result:
The result (whether it is a push-up or not) is displayed on the image using OpenCV's putText function.
The image with the result is shown in a window using imshow, and the program waits for a key press before closing the window.
